# Limitations and Constraints Report: Real-Time Radar Processing System

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of the limitations and constraints in the current Real-Time Radar Processing System implementation. By systematically examining each component of the system, we have identified various technical, performance, and architectural constraints that may impact the system's functionality, scalability, and applicability to different use cases. Understanding these limitations is crucial for future development efforts and for users to properly assess the system's suitability for specific applications.

## 1. Core System Limitations

### 1.1 Launcher Application (launcher.py)

The launcher application serves as the entry point to the system but has several limitations:

```python
# From launcher.py
def launch_application(self, app_path, app_name):
    """Launch an application and handle errors."""
    try:
        # Check if an application is already running
        if self.current_app_process is not None:
            # Terminate the currently running application
            try:
                self.status_bar.showMessage(f"Closing {self.current_app_name}...")
                self.current_app_process.terminate()
                # Give it a moment to terminate
                self.current_app_process.wait(timeout=2)
                self.status_bar.showMessage(f"{self.current_app_name} closed successfully")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error closing {self.current_app_name}: {str(e)}")
                # Continue anyway to launch the new application
```

**Limitations:**
- **Single Application Execution**: The launcher can only run one visualization mode at a time, preventing simultaneous multi-view analysis
- **Limited Error Recovery**: While the launcher attempts to handle errors when closing applications, it continues with new application launch regardless of success, potentially leading to resource leaks
- **Fixed Application Paths**: The application paths are hardcoded, making it difficult to extend with new visualization modes without modifying the launcher code
- **Platform Dependency**: The launcher uses Windows-specific process management techniques, limiting cross-platform compatibility

### 1.2 Configuration File (config/AWR1843_cfg.cfg)

The radar configuration file defines the operational parameters but imposes several constraints:

```
% From AWR1843_cfg.cfg
% Maximum unambiguous Range(m):9.02
% Maximum Radial Velocity(m/s):1
% Radial velocity resolution(m/s):0.13
% Frame Duration(msec):100
```

**Limitations:**
- **Range Limitation**: Maximum unambiguous range limited to 9.02 meters
- **Velocity Limitation**: Maximum radial velocity limited to 1 m/s
- **Frame Rate Limitation**: Fixed frame duration of 100ms (10 FPS)
- **Fixed Configuration**: Parameters are statically defined and cannot be dynamically adjusted during operation
- **Single Radar Profile**: The configuration supports only one radar profile at a time, preventing adaptive sensing based on conditions

## 2. Data Acquisition Limitations

### 2.1 UDP Listener (rp_real_time_process.py, rd_real_time_process.py, ra_real_time_process.py)

The UDP listener component handles data reception but has several constraints:

```python
# From rp_real_time_process.py
class UdpListener(th.Thread):
    """Thread class for receiving and processing UDP data streams from radar."""
    
    def run(self):
        """Main thread execution loop for receiving UDP data."""
        try:
            # Configure data type for binary conversion
            data_type = np.dtype(np.int16).newbyteorder('<')
            frame_buffer = []
            frame_count = 0
            
            # Initialize socket with error handling
            try:
                self.data_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
                self.data_socket.bind(self.data_address)
                self.data_socket.settimeout(SOCKET_TIMEOUT)
                logger.info("UDP socket created successfully")
                logger.info("Starting data stream reception")
            except socket.error as e:
                logger.error(f"Socket initialization failed: {e}")
                return
```

**Limitations:**
- **Fixed Data Format**: The listener expects a specific data format (16-bit signed integers in little-endian format), limiting compatibility with different radar hardware
- **Single Data Source**: The listener can only receive data from one radar device at a time
- **Limited Error Recovery**: Socket errors can cause the entire listener thread to terminate
- **Fixed Buffer Size**: The buffer size is predefined, which may lead to data loss with high-throughput configurations
- **No Packet Reordering**: The system does not handle out-of-order UDP packets, potentially causing data corruption with network issues

### 2.2 Radar Configuration (radar_config.py)

The radar configuration component handles communication with the radar hardware:

```python
# From Range Profile/radar_config.py
class SerialConfig():
    def __init__(self, name, CLIPort, BaudRate):
        self.name = name
        self.CLIPort = serial.Serial(CLIPort, baudrate=BaudRate)

    def SendConfig(self, ConfigFileName):
        for line in open(ConfigFileName):
            self.CLIPort.write((line.rstrip('\r\n') + '\n').encode())
            print(line)
            time.sleep(0.01)
```

**Limitations:**
- **Serial Communication Only**: The system only supports serial communication with the radar, limiting compatibility with Ethernet-based radar devices
- **Fixed Baud Rate**: The baud rate is set at initialization and cannot be dynamically adjusted
- **Limited Error Handling**: No robust error handling for serial communication failures
- **No Configuration Validation**: The system does not validate configuration commands before sending them to the radar
- **Blocking Operations**: The `time.sleep(0.01)` introduces delays that could impact real-time performance with complex configurations

## 3. Signal Processing Limitations

### 3.1 DSP Modules (rp_dsp.py, rd_dsp.py, ra_dsp.py)

The DSP modules implement signal processing algorithms but have several constraints:

```python
# From rp_dsp.py
def calculate_range_profile(radar_data: np.ndarray, radar_params: Optional[RadarParameters] = None, 
                          remove_clutter: bool = False, use_pulse_compression: bool = True,
                          window_type: str = 'blackmanharris', range_padding: Optional[int] = None) -> tuple:
    """
    Calculate range profile from radar data using FFT processing and averaging across chirps.
    """
    # Processing implementation...
```

**Limitations:**
- **Limited Algorithm Selection**: The system implements a fixed set of algorithms without the ability to plug in custom processing modules
- **Python Performance Overhead**: The use of Python for signal processing introduces performance overhead compared to compiled languages
- **Memory Intensive**: The processing pipeline creates multiple intermediate arrays, leading to high memory usage
- **Limited Filtering Options**: Basic clutter removal is implemented, but more advanced filtering techniques are not available
- **Fixed Processing Pipeline**: The processing sequence is fixed and cannot be dynamically reconfigured

### 3.2 CFAR Detection (rp_dsp.py, rd_dsp.py, ra_dsp.py)

The CFAR detection implementation has several limitations:

```python
# From rp_dsp.py
def apply_cfar(range_profile: np.ndarray, cfar_params: dict = None) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, List[Tuple[float, float]]]:
    """
    Apply Cell-Averaging Constant False Alarm Rate (CA-CFAR) detection with peak grouping.
    """
    # Set default parameters if not provided
    if cfar_params is None:
        cfar_params = {
            'guard_cells': 2,
            'training_cells': 4,
            'pfa': 0.1,
            'group_peaks': True
        }
```

**Limitations:**
- **Limited CFAR Variants**: Only Cell-Averaging CFAR is implemented, without support for OS-CFAR, GO-CFAR, or other variants
- **Fixed Parameter Selection**: Default parameters may not be optimal for all scenarios
- **1D Processing Only**: The CFAR implementation works on 1D profiles, without native support for 2D CFAR
- **Limited Adaptivity**: The algorithm does not adapt to changing noise conditions automatically
- **Performance Bottleneck**: The implementation uses Python loops for cell processing, which can be a performance bottleneck

### 3.3 Clutter Removal (rp_dsp.py, rd_dsp.py, ra_dsp.py)

The clutter removal implementation has several constraints:

```python
# From rp_dsp.py
def remove_static_clutter(range_data: np.ndarray, n_components: int = 2) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Remove static clutter from range profile data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
    """
    # Center the data by removing the mean
    data_mean = np.mean(range_data, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    centered_data = range_data - data_mean
    
    # Calculate covariance matrix
    covariance_matrix = np.cov(centered_data.T)
```

**Limitations:**
- **Fixed Component Selection**: The number of components to remove is fixed at 2 by default, which may not be optimal for all scenarios
- **Memory Intensive**: The PCA implementation requires computing the full covariance matrix, which can be memory intensive for large data
- **Limited Clutter Models**: Only static clutter removal is implemented, without support for dynamic clutter models
- **No Adaptive Thresholding**: The implementation does not include adaptive thresholding for clutter vs. target discrimination
- **Performance Overhead**: The eigenvalue decomposition can be computationally expensive for real-time processing

## 4. Visualization Limitations

### 4.1 Range Profile Visualization (rp_main.py, rp_app_layout.py)

The Range Profile visualization has several limitations:

```python
# From rp_main.py
def update_figure() -> None:
    """Update range profile plot with new data."""
    global plot_rpl, update_time, plot_widget, ui, radar_params, processor
    
    # Calculate time since last update
    now = time.time()
    dt = now - update_time
    
    # Use non-blocking queue gets with short timeout to prevent UI freezing
    try:
        # Try to get range profile data with a short timeout
        try:
            range_profile_data, range_axis, detected_points = range_profile_queue.get(timeout=0.01)
            update_figure.last_range_profile = (range_profile_data, range_axis, detected_points)
        except Empty:
            # Use the last known data if available
            if hasattr(update_figure, 'last_range_profile'):
                range_profile_data, range_axis, detected_points = update_figure.last_range_profile
            else:
                # Skip this update if no data is available yet
                logger.debug("No range profile data available yet")
                schedule_next_update(jitter)
                return
```

**Limitations:**
- **Fixed Update Rate**: The visualization targets a fixed 10 FPS update rate, which may not be optimal for all scenarios

- **No Data Recording**: The system does not support recording and playback of radar data
- **Limited Annotation**: Minimal annotation of detected objects and features
- **Fixed Plot Configuration**: Plot parameters (axes, scales, etc.) are largely fixed and not easily customizable

### 4.2 Range Doppler Visualization (rd_main.py, rd_app_layout.py)

The Range Doppler visualization has specific limitations:

```python
# From rd_main.py (inferred based on similar structure to rp_main.py)
# Range Doppler visualization code would have similar limitations
```

**Limitations:**
- **2D Visualization Constraints**: The 2D heatmap visualization may have limited resolution for closely spaced targets

- **No Velocity Tracking**: The visualization does not track velocity changes over time
- **Limited Doppler Resolution**: The Doppler resolution is constrained by the radar configuration
- **No Multi-Target Tracking**: The system does not implement multi-target tracking algorithms

### 4.3 Range Angle Visualization (ra_main.py, ra_app_layout.py, coordinate_transforms.py)

The Range Angle visualization has specific constraints:

```python
# From Range Angle/coordinate_transforms.py
def polar_to_cartesian(r, theta):
    """Convert polar coordinates to cartesian coordinates."""
    x = r * np.cos(theta)
    y = r * np.sin(theta)
    return x, y

def cartesian_to_polar(x, y):
    """Convert cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates."""
    r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    theta = np.arctan2(y, x)
    return r, theta
```

**Limitations:**
- **Limited Angular Resolution**: The angular resolution is constrained by the virtual array configuration

    """Thread class for processing radar data and generating visualizations."""
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, config: List[int], 
                 binary_queue: Queue, range_doppler_queue: Queue, 
                 range_profile_queue: Queue, range_angle_queue: Queue = None,
                 selected_channel: int = 0, radar_params=None):
        """Initialize with additional processing resources."""
        super().__init__(name=name)
        self._stop_event = th.Event()
        self.remove_clutter = False  # Flag for static clutter removal
        self.window_type = 'blackmanharris'  # Default window type (Blackman-Harris)
        self.range_padding = 256  # Default range padding
        
        # Initialize thread pool for parallel processing
        self.thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4)
```

**Limitations:**

def cleanup() -> None:
    """Cleanup all resources and stop data collection."""
    global collector, processor, fpga_socket, radar_ctrl
    logger.info("Starting cleanup...")
    
    # Stop radar
    if hasattr(radar_ctrl, 'StopRadar'):
        try:
            radar_ctrl.StopRadar()
            logger.info("Radar stopped")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error(f"Error stopping radar: {e}")
    
    # Stop threads with proper cleanup
    for thread, name in [(collector, "Collector"), (processor, "Processor")]:
        if thread and thread.is_alive():
            try:
                thread.stop()
                thread.join(timeout=1)
                if thread.is_alive():
                    logger.warning(f"{name} thread taking longer to stop, waiting...")
                    thread.join(timeout=3)
                    if thread.is_alive():
                        logger.warning(f"{name} thread did not stop gracefully")
                    else:
                        logger.info(f"{name} thread stopped successfully")
            except AttributeError as e:
                logger.error(f"Error stopping {name} thread: Missing stop method")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Error stopping {name} thread: {e}")
```

**Limitations:**
- **Limited Timeout Handling**: Thread termination uses fixed timeouts that may not be sufficient for all scenarios
- **Global State Management**: The use of global variables for resource management can lead to state inconsistencies
- **Limited Error Recovery**: Error handling during cleanup is limited to logging without recovery mechanisms
- **Resource Leak Potential**: Incomplete cleanup in error scenarios could lead to resource leaks
- **No Resource Monitoring**: The system does not monitor resource usage or provide warnings for resource constraints

        self.config_file_path = config_file_path
        self.config_params = self._parse_config_file()
        # Range offset calibration parameter (in meters)
        # Negative value means objects are displayed farther than they actually are
        # Positive value means objects are displayed closer than they actually are
        # For example, if an object at 1m is displayed at 2m, use -1.0 to correct it
        self.range_offset = -1.0
        # Base range padding size for calibration (default is 256)
        # This is used to scale the range offset when different padding sizes are used
        self.base_range_padding = 256
        # Flag to indicate if range offset should be automatically adjusted based on padding
        self.auto_adjust_offset = True
```

**Limitations:**

### 6.2 Processing Parameters (rp_dsp.py, rd_dsp.py, ra_dsp.py)

The processing parameters have several limitations:

```python
# From rp_dsp.py
def suggest_padding_size(data_shape: tuple, radar_params: Optional[RadarParameters] = None,
                        range_padding: Optional[int] = None) -> List[int]:
    """
    Get FFT padding sizes based on input dimensions and user-specified padding.
    """
    num_rx, _ = data_shape
    if radar_params is not None:
        num_chirps = radar_params.config_params['chirps_per_frame'] * radar_params.config_params['num_loops']
        num_adc_samples = radar_params.config_params['adc_samples']
    else:
        num_adc_samples = 256  # Default ADC samples
        num_chirps = data_shape[1] // num_adc_samples
