## A.4 System Architecture

### A.4.1 Software Components

The software is organized into three main applications, each focusing on a different radar processing domain:

1. **Range Profile Application**
   - 1D radar processing (range domain)
   - Detects object distance
   - Displays signal power vs. range

2. **Range Doppler Application**
   - 2D radar processing (range-velocity domain)
   - Detects object distance and velocity
   - Displays range-Doppler heatmap

3. **Range Angle Application**
   - 2D radar processing (range-azimuth domain)
   - Detects object distance and angle
   - Displays range-angle heatmap

Each application shares common components:
- Configuration interface

#### Application-Specific Components

Each application (Range Profile, Range Doppler, Range Angle) follows a similar structure:

1. **Main Application Module** (`xx_main.py`)
   - Initializes the application
   - Sets up the GUI
   - Manages the application lifecycle

2. **DSP Module** (`xx_dsp.py`)

### A.4.2 Data Flow

The data flow through the system follows these steps:

1. **Configuration**
   - User selects radar parameters via the application GUI
   - Parameters are sent to XWR1843 via serial interface
   - DCA1000 is configured via Ethernet for data capture

2. **Data Acquisition**
   - XWR1843 transmits FMCW chirps
   - Received signals are sampled by ADCs
   - Raw ADC samples are streamed to DCA1000
   - DCA1000 forwards data to host PC via Ethernet (UDP)

3. **Signal Processing**
   - Raw ADC data is received by UDP listener
   - Data is organized into frames and channels
   - Signal processing is performed based on application type:
     - Range Profile: 1D FFT for range detection
     - Range Doppler: 2D FFT for range and velocity
     - Range Angle: 2D FFT and beamforming for range and angle
   - CFAR detection identifies targets in processed data

4. **Visualization**
   - Processed data is displayed in real-time
   - Different visualization types based on application:
     - Range Profile: 1D plot of signal power vs. range
     - Range Doppler: 2D heatmap of range vs. velocity
     - Range Angle: 2D heatmap of range vs. angle
   - Detected targets are highlighted and listed in data table

### A.4.3 Signal Processing Pipeline

#### Range Profile Processing

1. **Data Organization**
   - Raw ADC data is organized by RX channel and chirp
   - Data is converted from 16-bit integers to complex values

2. **Range Processing**
   - Window function is applied to reduce sidelobes
   - Range FFT is performed on each chirp and channel
   - Optional zero-padding for better range resolution
   - Channels are combined (summed or selected)

3. **Detection**
   - CFAR detection identifies targets in range domain
   - Peak grouping combines nearby detections
   - Range and magnitude of targets are calculated

#### Range Doppler Processing

   - Same as Range Profile processing
   - Results in range-time data cube

2. **Doppler Processing**
   - Second FFT across chirps (slow-time dimension)
   - Results in range-velocity data
   - Static clutter removal (optional)

3. **Detection**
   - 2D CFAR detection in range-Doppler domain
   - Targets identified by range and velocity
