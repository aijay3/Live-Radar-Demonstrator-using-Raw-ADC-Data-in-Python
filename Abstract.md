# Abstract

This thesis presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a real-time data capture and processing system for Texas Instruments mmWave radar sensors (AWR1843X EVM) integrated with the DCA1000 EVM data capture card. The research addresses significant challenges in extracting and processing raw Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) data from mmWave radar systems, which traditionally require complex proprietary tools with limited real-time capabilities.

The work begins with a comprehensive exploration of radar fundamentals, focusing on Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar principles, chirp signal characteristics, and mmWave technology operating in the 76-81 GHz frequency range. A detailed analysis of signal processing techniques—including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operations for range, velocity, and angle estimation; Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) detection; and beamforming methods—establishes the theoretical foundation for the practical implementation.

The research identifies and documents critical challenges in the conventional Texas Instruments toolchain, particularly related to hardware integration, firmware compatibility, network configuration, and real-time processing limitations. To overcome these obstacles, a novel Python-based solution was developed featuring a modular, multi-threaded architecture that enables true real-time radar data acquisition, processing, and visualization. The system offers three specialized visualization modes: Range Profile for distance measurement, Range Doppler for velocity analysis, and Range Angle for spatial mapping.

Performance analysis demonstrates that the implemented system achieves consistent 10 frames-per-second visualization with sub-100ms processing latency, while maintaining theoretical range resolution of approximately 4.4cm, velocity resolution of 0.13m/s, and angular resolution of 30-38° based on the radar configuration. The software's intuitive user interface, parameter customization capabilities, and direct hardware communication eliminate the need for proprietary intermediate tools, significantly streamlining the workflow for radar data analysis.

The significance of this work lies in democratizing access to mmWave radar technology by reducing technical barriers, accelerating prototyping and experimentation, and enabling application-specific implementations across domains including smart cities, healthcare, automotive systems, and robotics. While current limitations include single-mode execution constraints and Python-based processing overhead, the system's extensible architecture provides a foundation for future enhancements such as machine learning integration, multi-radar support, and 3D visualization capabilities.

This research contributes to the field by bridging the gap between complex radar theory and practical implementation, offering an accessible platform for both educational purposes and advanced radar applications development.
